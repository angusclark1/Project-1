## New Age vs Old Age: what comes out on top?

### Project Description 

Create two portfolios, one being heavily invested in the new age of innovative businesses (such as buy now pay later, eco-technology and neo banks), and decentralised crypto-currency. The other being heavily invested in traditional businesses such as insurance and banking.

### Project Analysis 

Pull in data and analyse how the two portfolios track in the current market. 

Compare how both portfolios performed in comparison to 2 years previously during the covid upswing in prices (particularly In tech). 

Compare the performance of both portfolios against more historical data in a 10-year time frame.

Run Monte Carlos Simulations to compare and analyse how both portfolios differentiate to the future market.

Analyse and describe the difference in performance. Suggest why one investment method may be preferable to the other. Taking into consideration the current economic climate of Australia and the world.

 ### Economic Factors to take into consideration:

- Interest Rate fluctuations.
- Inflation Rate fluctuations.
- Probability of fluctuations in unemployment and wage growth failing to compete with inflation.
- The effects of Australiaâ€™s heavy investment in the property market during all-time low-interest rates.
- The possibility for the economy to hit an economical downswing.
- Human-related effects (e.g. failing to meet mortgage repayments).
